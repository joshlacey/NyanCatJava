#Nyan Cat Java Game

![Image of NyanCat Game](https://i.imgur.com/vtPmpK2.png)

A Nyan Cat Java game which started out as a clone of the famous Flappy Bird game.
I built this game to exercise my Java skills using an open source library called libgdx.
This is very much a work in progress.


To build and start for Mac: `./gradlew desktop:dist && java -jar ./desktop/build/libs/desktop-1.0.jar`

I don't intend on using this project for anything other than for funzies so feel free to clone the project and make it your own.
